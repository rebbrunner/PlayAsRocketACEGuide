    In this section we are going to be overriding sprites as part of our OAM hijack.  We will start by briefly going over how sprites are processed and end by overriding the overworld sprite, backsprite, and front sprites.  For those on original hardware without access to save injection, we will provide alternative options that should be more accessible than entering 300 or so bytes in by hand.

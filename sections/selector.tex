    As part of the setup for this guide, you should have installed a script selector.  This selector comes with the RAM writer and nickname writer pre-installed, however, we can extend the selector to be able to easily bind our own script.  In this section, we will be binding a code to allow us to steal opponent's pokemon to a new slot on the selector.
